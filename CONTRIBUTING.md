# Contributing to The Password Hall Of Shame

The Password Hall Of Shame is currently a simple YAML file.

Soon it will be turned into a shiny website.

If you know of a company with stupid password rules, please add them to the YAML file.

Stupid password rules are defined as:
- Having a maximum password length
- At least one capital letter or numerical
- Etc.
